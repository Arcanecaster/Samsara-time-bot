# Samsara-time-bot
A Py-cord bot made in a couple of hours, private for now but might open up when I make some improvement to remove hard-coded elements.

It's not really meant to be copied elsewhere, but you might wanna dig through it if you're making a similar project. Or if you're spicy, you can just add it somewhere else.
